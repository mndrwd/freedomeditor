Freedomeditor is targeted to be a fully browser based file manager + website editing interface.

However, i as the author did not work on the project since 2012. As smartphones came into the field, i wasn't sure where the project should be heading.
Also i started to get really annoyed with the neverending browser issues and inconsistenties inbetween, and thus i decided to pause the project, 
until browser development would start to stabilize.

Anyone interested in commiting or discussing project future is welcome to contact me.

Current status: not secure for installation in a production environment, unless using .htaccess folder protection, and issues have been fully read and understood.
