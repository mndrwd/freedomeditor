This is a fast&effective mysql database backup import/export solution.


IMPORT:
if you have a host on which you only want to do imports you only need
dbtool_imp.php
dbtool_conf.inc.php
dbtool_preexec.php
dbtool_fc.inc.php
running on it

CONFIG:
just read dbtool_conf.inc.php
if you dont understand it, you probably dont want to.

comment #1:
you may choose how to integrate this into your admin script

either use iframe, include dbtool.php, or just link to dbtool.php

if you 
1- use iframe/ just link to vars.php:
$db_tool['sess']="off";		 needs to be enabled for build in security

if you
2- include vars.php as a plugin for your script
$db_passget_a[]=  can be used to pass $_GET array contents to the url.

further it is advised to keep "mysqlbkup" in its seperate directory.
note that you manually need to create the folder that holds the database folder(s)
which you also have to create manually
