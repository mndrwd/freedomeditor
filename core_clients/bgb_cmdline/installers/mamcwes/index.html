<h3>What's that?</h3>
Fine working php class for mysql connectivity, with back and forward compatbility support concerning API calls, for php 4, php 5, mysql, mysqli client librarys.

<h3>For who is it?</h3>
PHP writers / developers / coders generally.
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
Besides the basic functionality one would expect from a mysql(i) class one could send a userlevel variable to it, for example from a logged in user, to select a specific mysql connection.<br />
Also the content from the config file will only be loaded to the php memory when nessecary and immediately unloaded afterwards.
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
$this->gl_conf_ulvl in the mysqlcfgdata.inc.php is the userlevel setting. Default it loads from $_SESSION['rdmstring'].<br />
One should use the escstr function to parse any kind of user input. <br />
Looking at the class (functions) name(s), it won't be too hard figuring out how to make the DB connection / calls.<br />
It supports php4 with mysql client library<br />
It supports php5 with both mysql and mysqli client library<br />
