====================================
End user GUI issues:
------------------------------------

*0.2.6+: Current basic tabbed browsing has limits, 
limited amount of tabs can be opened. 

Also currently there is a issue which sometimes causes double tabs to appear,
due to the folder reference being wrong. Current solution is to just close the tab, untill i notice, or someone reports me when exactly this happens.

toolbox > bgb - find failure @ unix



    * [low priority] 
Executing a command in phpterm that does not return prompt will 
probably cause your
windows webserver process to hang, forcing you to perform a 
webserver software reboot. This does not seem to occur on freebsd.


		* [low priority]
		aateau.sh (archive extraction) fails in certain circumstances

BUG 1: -v low priority
fc/client/make_object.php:
wrong -userinput- written to cache ; 
workaround cache loading disabled, realtime retrieving
line 18 : #skipthiscacheload=true


2: -low priority
javascript check for sidebar _contents frame when file is loaded with ajax, atm when not using the firefox sidebar, contents get loaded twice upon file opening.

3: -v low priority
The {urlstr} template directive may not always behave correctly with jquery ajax, use {folder}, {rawele} and/or {ele} instead.

4: -v low priority
Changing optional default_gui setting breaks tinymce. 

NOTE: There may be more bugs out there...
